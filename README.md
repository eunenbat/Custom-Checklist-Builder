##I have implemented most of the functionality in the requirements.

##What I am missing:
* easy login/register/logout since right now you have to type in the pages in the address bar
* cloning of a checklist; I was so focused on having a working implementation that I forgot about this feature
* users can edit the checklist items but not the title of the checklist itself
* users can view the checklists from the shareable link but they can only check/uncheck the items (no file uploads)
	* I did not get to implementing the file uploading without authentication

##Tech Stack:
React + TS frontend
Django Python backend
Built in Django SQlite db
