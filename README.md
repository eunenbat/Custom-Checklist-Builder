## Collaborative Checklists
* Able to create and share custom checklists with a link
* Checklists shared through a link can be edited by anyone with the link
* Create an account to create/save checklists

## What I am missing:
* easy login/register/logout since right now you have to type in the pages in the address bar
* cloning of a checklist; I was so focused on having a working implementation that I forgot about this feature
* users can edit the checklist items but not the title of the checklist itself
* users can view the checklists from the shareable link but they can only check/uncheck the items (no file uploads)
	* I did not get to implementing the file uploading without authentication

## Tech Stack:
* React + TS frontend
* Django Python backend
* Built in Django SQlite db
